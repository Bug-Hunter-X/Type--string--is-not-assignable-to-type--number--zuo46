# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string is assigned to a variable of type number.  The error arises when the type of a variable is explicitly defined as number, but a string value is assigned to it.  TypeScript's type system helps to catch this error during compilation, preventing runtime errors.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Compile the code using the TypeScript compiler: `tsc bug.ts`.
4. Observe the type error generated by the compiler.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all values assigned to variables of type number are indeed of type number. Type checking and guarding are critical for preventing such errors and ensuring the reliability of TypeScript code.
